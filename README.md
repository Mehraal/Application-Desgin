# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Gaming room is a gaming application which is only available on Anodriod systems and the client would like to expand it # to a web-based game. The game contains multiple games and multiple teams and players. Team names should be unique for the game to function properly.


# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did eplain the design contraints and development requirement very thuroughly.


# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The development requirements was explained very thuroughly and it was easy to follow the steps and process when developing the code.


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would explain the developments deeper to make it understandable even for non technical clients.


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's need eliminates vague development, what i mean by that is when we have clear explanation on the requirements and create the software design based on that it will help us eliminate redundant coding and save time by focusing only on the requirements from the client.


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was to start revieing the UML diagram to understand the functionality of the application and what needs to be included in the game and how each funtion will affect the game and the users interacting with it. i would always start with the UML diagram which is similar to psuedo coding and it helps me understand the requirements and the flow of the application.
